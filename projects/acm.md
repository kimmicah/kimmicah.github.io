Association for Computing Machinery at University of Hawai'i at Manoa (ACM Manoa) is the largest computer science student organization which is split into special interest groups (SIG) to provide social, professional, and technical help for its members (<a href="http://acmanoa.github.io">ACM Manoa</a>). 

One of the SIG's that I decided to take part in was Grey Hats, where I learned more about cyber security. It was very interesting learning about how people attack systems and also defend them. We learned through group training session and occasionally learned some of the best cyber-defense practices from professionals. I found it a good idea to learn more about cyber security due to the fact that there is currently an excess of jobs available within cyber security, which means that as long as you know your material, you won't have to worry about getting the job.

Through ACM Manoa, I've been able to establish many new connections and gain a lot of new knowledge that might not be particularly taught within classes. I've been able to learn at an accelerated rate thanks to ACM and will continue to be an active member to get the help that I need.
