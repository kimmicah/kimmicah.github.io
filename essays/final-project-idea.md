## Overview
The problem: The parking situation at UH Manoa is rather inefficient for there is currently no implemented way to check whether or not the lot is actually full. There are many times where there is available parking but many students/staff are denied entry because the staff believes that the lot is full. Also, there is no way of knowing whether or not the lot is full without actually going to the front of the parking structure.

The solution: An interactive map that uses entry and exit data to notify students/staff what lots are open and can recommend a lot based on open space, type of permit, and proximity to destination.
