## Overview
The problem: The parking situation at UH Manoa is rather inefficient for there is currently no implemented way to check whether or not the lot is actually full. There are many times where there is available parking but many students/staff are denied entry because the parking staff believes that the lot is full. Their standards of "full" is when the lot is relatively full, meaning there almost always is at least one parking spot open because cars are always leaving. The current system in checking for availability of parking within the structure is not only detrimental for students who need to get to class, but also to the school, for they are missing out on potential buyers for one-day parking passes. Also, there is no way of knowing whether or not the lot is full without actually going to the front of the parking structure.

The solution: An interactive map that uses entry and exit data to notify students/staff what lots are open and can recommend a lot based on open space, the type of permit (carpool/staff/student), and proximity to destination.

## Approach
Users can see the map without an account. When a user makes a profile they will submit information about their vehicle, permit, and their destination on campus. 

Mockup pages include:
* Landing Page (Map)
* Login Page
* User Profile Page
* Admin Page
* Suggestions Page

## Use case ideas
* Casual user can look at the landing page (map) without setting up an account
* New user can log in, set up their profile, and view suggestions page
* Existing user can log, modify their profile, and view suggestions page

## Beyond the basics
* Allowing nearby parking lots to also add information to the map
* Adding prices to each available parking space
* Having the ability to look at historic data
