# Ask the Right Way

## Asking Questions as a Software Engineer
All my life I've been asking questions, but ever since I started studying Computer Science, asking questions have not only been different but a bit more difficult as well. I believe the main reason for this change is because in programming, there is usually never only one correct answer. This means that when you do ask a question as a software engineer, the answer you receive might be correct, but it might not be the answer you were looking for. However, in order to become a skilled software engineer (or any other job as a matter of fact), it is very important to ask questions, but how do we ask questions the "right way"? Fortunately, in "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Steven Raymond, we are informed of how to ask smart questions that invoke high-quality answers, which will guide me and all other future software engineers to succeed (<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questoins The Smart Way</a>).

## A Not-So-Smart Question
Asking a not-so-smart question is not only a waste of your time but also a waste of time to the people who genuinely want to help you out. These types of questions will also get a negative response and lots of downvotes, which you will not be getting anything out of other than a lowered self-esteem.

For example, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54341878/how-to-use-addtime-mysql">question</a> can already be seen as a not-so-smart question by the amount of downvotes it has already received. At the time this is being written, the question has been up for about 20 minutes but already has 3 downvotes, which is clearly not a good sign. It is also evident that the question is being written by someone who's first language is not English, but does not give any sort of alert to potential respondents. To top it off, in the comments section, people are confused, saying things like "You say you're trying but why not provide evidence" and asking "What specifically are you having a problem with?" All signs point to the example being a not-so-smart question due to the fact that the question has very little detail and seems to have been written in a rush.

This example is proof that not-so-smart questions are a waste of time and will most likely not receive the answer you are looking for. Please do not ask not-so-smart questions...

## A Smart Question
One of the most important things when asking a smart question is to put yourself in the shoes of potential respondents. Smart questions should have a great amount of detail and background information so that the readers will know where to begin in answering your question. If you can give your potential respondents enough of the right information in a presentable format, you will be able to invoke high-quality answers, and have therefore created a smart question.

For example, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54120862/does-the-c-standard-allow-for-an-uninitialized-bool-to-crash-a-program">question</a> can be seen as a smart question by the large amount of upvotes, positive response, and many high-quality answers. One of the very first responses start with "It's a great question" and I can agree for the author added a perfect amount of detail to the question, including background information as well as complementary code, which all contributes to making it a "great" question. In addition, the cleverness of the question itself has garnered a lot of attention and is also a huge factor in creating a smart question.

The example is all about what a smart question should be and 

## Asking Questions as a (Smart) Software Engineer
As you learn more as a software, the amount of questions you have will undoubtedly grow, so it is very important to ask smart questions that will invoke high-quality answers.
