## Patterns Are Everywhere
Whether you have noticed or not, patterns are everywhere. Even the simplest of patterns, such as building blocks, can have an impact on childrens' lives because it teaches them about life in an "idiot-proof" manner. If you actually take the time to look around, you can see the patterns within shapes and colors and numbers that share a consistency that is almost scary. Without even recognizing these patterns, most people are able to make predictions that make everyday life easier. 

I can list tons of examples where patterns are beneficially used in everyday life, but the one that is best suited for the scope of this class and this essay, are the patterns present in a school/learning environment. For example, when solving math problems, you might see yourself reusing prior knowledge to solve parts of the problem in order to find the answer to the parent problem. Solving math problems is a prime example of patterns, because they help us recognize when certain aspects to a problem are reusable, thus making everything much more efficient.

## Design Patterns in Programming
Similarly to patterns in math problems, design patterns are widely utilized by software engineers because it helps them to not only write code more efficiently, but also to break down extensive pieces of code in order to debug. The ICS Class that I am taking at the time of writing this has greatly helped me utilize design patterns to find relationships and interactions between certain aspects of code. Finding these parallel aspects within my code has helped me to prevent rewriting the same code over and over again.

## Utilizing Patterns = Success
Patterns are all around us. At home or at school or at work, the majority of people have probably experienced patterns and have either intentionally or unintentionally utilized them to their advantage. Understanding and utilizing patterns helps us work smarter and more efficiently, and also to have a better understanding of what "life" really is, which is why it is a monumental factor for one's success.
