A third year undergraduate student at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Micah Kim has a commitment to help others and tackle any challenge. While being a Computer Science major, he has also taken the prerequisites necessary in order to begin his journey to being a professional physician at medical school. Mr. Kim has been raised as a Seventh-Day Adventist in his family, therefore he has taken a path of forgiveness, patience, and giving since he can remember. He has taught students of numerous ages at VBS and KAYAMM as a representative of Los Angeles Korean SDA Church about the miracles of Christ and has always been eager to repair the wounds that certain students had experienced in the past. Ever since moving to Hawai'i, he has flown out to California whenever he had the chance to continue his volunteer work in helping people who have been lost in their lives. His most recent volunteering experience was his teaching role at the Honolulu Korean SDA Church. He has also shown his leadership and hardwork by being the captain and #1 ranked player on the tennis team at Moanalua High School. He would be the first to be on the court and the last to leave. He would be there for his coach to provide assistance whenever the coach asked. Most importantly, he always had the ability to bring about laughter, which would bring the team closer together and help overcome many obstacles. He would also never neglect anyone no matter their rank on the team. He truly cared not only for the sport, but for the well-being of his teammates. He and his team also participated in various volunteering work such as serving at a homeless food shelter in Downtown Honolulu and hosting charity tennis tournaments. Mr. Kim plans to continue his journey by using his background in Computer Science and his devotion to Christ to care for those in need.
